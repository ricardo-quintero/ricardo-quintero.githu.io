              "abstract": "Random testing of Android apps is attractive due to ease-of-use and scalability, but its effectiveness could be questioned. Prior studies have shown that Monkey – a simple approach and tool for random testing of Android apps – is surprisingly effective, \"beating\" much more sophisticated tools by achieving higher coverage. We study how Monkey's parameters affect code coverage (at class, method, block, and line levels) and set out to answer several research questions centered around improving the effectiveness of Monkey-based random testing in Android, and how it compares with manual exploration. First, we show that random stress testing via Monkey is extremely efficient (85 seconds on average) and effective at crashing apps, including 15 widely-used apps that have millions (or even billions) of installs. Second, we vary Monkey's event distribution to change app behavior and measured the resulting coverage. We found that, except for isolated cases, altering Monkey's default event distribution is unlikely to lead to higher coverage.

Prior studies have shown that Monkey – a simple approach and tool for random testing of Android apps – is surprisingly effective, \"beating\" much more sophisticated tools by achieving higher coverage. We study how Monkey's parameters affect code coverage (at class, method, block, and line levels) and set out to answer several research questions centered around improving the effectiveness of Monkey-based random testing in Android, and how it compares with manual exploration. First, we show that random stress testing via Monkey is extremely efficient (85 seconds on average) and effective at crashing apps, including 15 widely-used apps that have millions (or even billions) of installs. Second, we vary Monkey's event distribution to change app behavior and measured the resulting coverage. We found that, except for isolated cases, altering Monkey's default event distribution is unlikely to lead to higher coverage. Third, we manually explore 62 apps and compare the resulting coverages; we found that coverage achieved via manual exploration is just 2-3% higher than that achieved via Monkey exploration. Finally, our analysis shows that coarse-grained coverage is highly indicative of fine-grained coverage, hence coarse-grained coverage (which imposes low collection overhead) hits a performance vs accuracy sweet spot.",

In this paper we evaluate similarity-based test case selection (SBTCS) on integration-level tests executed on continuous integration pipelines of two companies. We select test cases that maximise diversity of test coverage and reduce feedback time to developers. Our results confirm existing evidence that SBTCS is a strong candidate for test optimisation, by reducing feedback time (up to 92% faster in our case studies) while achieving full test coverage using only information from test artefacts themselves.",

              "abstract": "Background: A grand challenge for Requirement Engineering (RE) research is to help practitioners understand which RE methods work in what contexts and why. RE researchers recognize that for an RE method to be adopted in industry, RE practitioners should be able to evaluate the relevance of empirical studies to their practice. One possible approach to relevance evaluation is the set of perspective-based checklists proposed by Kitchenham et al. Specifically, the checklist from the practitioner's perspective seems to be a good candidate for evaluating the relevance of RE studies to RE practice. However, little is known about the applicability of this checklist to the RE field. Moreover, this checklist also requires a deeper analysis of its reliability. Aim: We propose a perspective-based checklist to the RE community that allows evaluating the relevance of experimental studies in RE from the practitioner's/consultant's viewpoint. Method: We followed an iterative design-science based approach in which we first analyzed the problems with a previously published checklist and then developed an operationalized proposal for a new checklist to counter these problems. We performed a reliability evaluation of this new checklist by having two practitioners apply the checklist on 24 papers that report experimental results on software requirements specifications' comprehensibility. Results: We report first-hand experiences of practitioners in evaluating the relevance of primary studies in RE, by using a perspective-based checklist. With respect to the reliability of the adjusted checklist, 9 of out 19 questions show an acceptable proportion of agreement (between two practitioners). Conclusions: Based on our experience, the contextualization and operationalization of a perspective-based checklist helps to make it more useful for the practitioners. However, to increase the reliability of the checklist, more reviewers and more discussion cycles are necessary.",

However, given that there are several kinds of case studies, each with its own strengths and weaknesses, researchers need to know how to choose which kind to employ for a specific research study. Aim: The objective of this research is to compare two case study approaches: embedded, longitudinal case studies, and multi-case studies. Approach: We compared two actual software engineering case studies: a multi-case study involving interviews with 46 practitioners at 9 international companies engaged in offshoring and outsourcing, and a single case, participant observation embedded case study lasting 13 months in a mid-sized Irish software company. Both case studies were exploring similar problems of understanding the activities performed by members of scrum development teams. Results: We found that both multi-case and embedded case studies are suitable for exploratory research (hypothesis development) but that embedded research may also be more suitable for explanatory research (hypothesis testing). We also found that longitudinal case studies offer better confirmability, while multi-case studies offer better transferability.

              "abstract": "Communication and collaboration is a major challenge for large-scale software development. Cognitive and psychological distance between individuals and teams affect this collaboration and can cause communications gaps. We propose a novel method for assessing distance between teams, and explore potential explanations for these distances. In an exploratory case study of the quality assurance department at Axis Communications, we used interactive posters to collect data and obtained a 52% response rate from the 175 test engineers. We identified low psychological distance as an indicator of a company culture with open and frequent communication, and of a team with good social networking skills and well-functioning points of contact. We found that low cognitive distance is an indicator of differences regarding the responsibilities of a team; within the same system and between different types of systems. We also found correlations between psychological and cognitive distance.

Cognitive and psychological distance between individuals and teams affect this collaboration and can cause communications gaps. We propose a novel method for assessing distance between teams, and explore potential explanations for these distances. In an exploratory case study of the quality assurance department at Axis Communications, we used interactive posters to collect data and obtained a 52% response rate from the 175 test engineers. We identified low psychological distance as an indicator of a company culture with open and frequent communication, and of a team with good social networking skills and well-functioning points of contact. We found that low cognitive distance is an indicator of differences regarding the responsibilities of a team; within the same system and between different types of systems. We also found correlations between psychological and cognitive distance. Large organisations may apply our concept to assess distance between teams, and our finding can be useful in interpreting these distances. Furthermore, our results provide a basis for further research on how the concept of distances can be used to assess collaboration within large organisations.",

A new method called SPIRAL (Support for Participant Involvement in Rapid and Agile software development Labs) is proposed which adds both sustainability and flexibility to the development process with older adults.

In such systems, safety assurance cases (SACs) are an emerging approach that adopts a proactive strategy to produce structuralized safety justifications and arguments. While SACs are recommended in many software-intensive safety-critical domains, the lack of knowledge regarding the practitioners' perspectives on using SACs hinders effective adoption of this approach. To gain such knowledge, we interviewed nine practitioners and safety experts who focused on safety-critical software systems. In general, our participants found the SAC approach beneficial for communication of safety arguments and management of safety issues in a multidisciplinary setting. The challenges they faced when using SACs were primarily associated with (1) a lack of tool support, (2) insufficient process integration, and (3) scarcity of experienced personnel. To overcome those challenges, our participants suggested tactics that focused on creating direct safety arguments. Process and organizational adjustments are also needed to streamline SAC analysis and creation.

Workers on crowdsourcing platform do not have similar level of support as they get in traditional employment model, such as career guidance, compensation counseling, HR support, etc. To overcome the challenges crowd workers face, we propose \"CrowdAssistant\" which acts as a virtual buddy for the worker and helps them throughout their career journey on the platform. It even renders a level of support impossible for human managers and career counselors to provide. The proposed system acts as a personalized assistant and pro-actively supports worker's needs.

Workers on crowdsourcing platform do not have similar level of support as they get in traditional employment model, such as career guidance, compensation counseling, HR support, etc. To overcome the challenges crowd workers face, we propose \"CrowdAssistant\" which acts as a virtual buddy for the worker and helps them throughout their career journey on the platform. It even renders a level of support impossible for human managers and career counselors to provide. The proposed system acts as a personalized assistant and pro-actively supports worker's needs. It is the first of its kind to the best of our knowledge.",

While most existing studies show that increasing incentives tend to benefit crowdsourcing outcomes, i.e. broader participation and higher worker performance, some reported inconsistent observations. In addition, there is the lack of investigation in the domain of software crowdsourcing. To that end, this study examines the extent to which task pricing strategies are employed in software crowdsourcing. More specifically, it aims at investigating the impact of pricing strategies on worker’s behaviors and performance. It reports a conceptual model between pricing strategies and potential influences on worker behaviors, an algorithm for measuring the effect of pricing strategies, and an empirical evaluation on 434 crowdsourcing tasks extracted from TopCoder. The results show that: 1) Strategic task pricing patterns, i.e. under-pricing and over-pricing are prevalent in software crowdsourcing practices; 2) Overpriced tasks are more likely to attract more workers to register and submit, and have higher task completion velocity; 3) Underpriced tasks tend to associate with less registrants and submissions, and lower task completion velocity. These observations imply that task requesters can typically get their extra dollars investment paid-off if employing proactive task pricing strategy. However, it is also observed that it appears to be a counter-intuitive effect on the score of final deliverable. We believe the preliminary findings are helpful for task requesters in better pricing decision and hope to stimulate further discussions and research in pricing strategies of software crowdsourcing.",

We looked at keynote speakers and chairs in different roles and program committees, but not the participants themselves as reliable data was available only for the former. We investigated if gender distribution was similar to or different from the reported data for ICT as a whole.

Positive epistasis is rare as a fraction of the total search space but significant as a fraction of the objective space: 9% of the repairs we found to look (and 4.63% across all programs analyzed) were produced by positive interactions between mutations.

In this context, understanding the energy consumption of operations on data-structures is crucial when optimizing software to execute under power constricted environments.

To understand the relationship between CPU and memory energy consumptions with execution time, we instrument a microbenchmark suite to collect such values, and we analyze the results. Our benchmark suite is comprised of 16 implementations of functional sequences, collections and associative collections while measuring detailed energy and time metrics. We further investigate the energy consumption impact of using different compilation optimizations. We have concluded that energy consumption is directly proportional to execution time. Additionally, DRAM and Package energy consumptions are directly proportional, with the DRAM representing between 15 and 31% of the total energy consumption. Finally, we also conclude that optimizations can have both a positive or a negative impact on energy consumption.",

We set the source language to be English, and the target languages included Chinese, French, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and Swedish. A sample of 33,600 observations (involving a total of 100,800 actual translations) was collected and analyzed using a 3 x 56 factorial design. Based on this data, our model found Google Translate to be the best (in terms of the metamorphic relation used) for each and every target language considered. A trend for Indo-European languages producing better results was also identified.",

However, the test oracle problem makes it difficult to conduct automated testing. In this paper, we propose a Monte Carlo method, in combination with metamorphic testing, to overcome the oracle problem.

Results: Researchers have not frequently published papers concerning UML synthesis techniques since 2004.

Conclusion: Although UML diagrams synthesis doesn’t seem to be an active line of research, it is relevant since synthesis techniques rely on enforcing diagram consistency, which is an active line of research. We collected consistency rules which can be used to check UML models, specifically to verify if the diagrams of a model are consistent with one another.",

Conclusion: Although UML diagrams synthesis doesn’t seem to be an active line of research, it is relevant since synthesis techniques rely on enforcing diagram consistency, which is an active line of research. We collected consistency rules which can be used to check UML models, specifically to verify if the diagrams of a model are consistent with one another.",

The dialog component achieved resolution rates from 23% to 50% (depending on the dialog act) and introduces a negligible number of errors. We expect the overall performance to increase even further with the implementation of additional dialog acts.",

However, the reuse of pre-existing, third-party software components is not one of them. Software reuse is still primarily perceived as a time-consuming, unsystematic and ultimately, discontinuous activity even though it aims to deliver the same basic benefits as continuous software engineering - namely, a reduction in the time and effort taken to deliver quality software. However, the increasingly central role of testing in continuous software engineering offers a way of addressing this problem by exploiting the new generation of test-driven search engines that can harvest components based on tests. This search technology not only exploits artifacts that have already been created as part of the continuous testing process to harvest components, it returns results that have a high likelihood of being fit for purpose and thus of being worth reusing. In this paper, we propose to augment continuous software engineering with the rapid, continuous reuse of software code units by integrating the test-driven mining of software artifact repositories into the continuous integration process. More specifically, we propose to use tests written as part of the Test-First Development approach to perform test-driven searches for matching functionality while developers are working on their normal development activities. We discuss the idea of rapid, continuous code reuse based on recent advances in our test-driven search platform and elaborate on scenarios for its application in the future.",

Method: We propose an approach and a corresponding tool to analyze ROS nodes and their launch files to check consistency and issue warnings if potential problems are detected. The approach uses both static analysis of the launch files as well as dynamic analysis of individual ROS nodes to reconstruct the node graph without executing the whole launch configuration. The nodes are executed in a sandbox to prevent side effects and enable the integration of the analysis tool, e.g., into automated testing systems. Results: The evaluation on internal and publicly available ROS projects shows that we are able to reconstruct the complete architecture of the system if the nodes implement a common lifecycle. Conclusion: The approach enables ROS developers to avoid creating incompatible architectures and check consistency already at development time. The approach can be extended to also monitor architectural consistency at run time.",

A key challenge is the oracle problem, a situation in which appropriate mechanisms are unavailable for checking if the code produces the expected output when executed using a set of test cases (TCs). Metamorphic testing alleviates the oracle problem by specifying the relationship that a source TC and its follow-up TC shall meet. Such relationships are called metamorphic relations (MRs) which are necessary properties of the intended program's functionality. Existing approaches handle the MRs in a flat manner. This paper introduces a novel way to facilitate a hierarchy of MRs to be developed incrementally. We illustrate our approach by testing U.S. EPA's Storm Water Management Model (SWMM).

But companies are currently faced with a troublesome dilemma: Supplying customers with more features at greater speeds than in the past has become the norm; high feature velocity, fairly static engineering headcounts, and shorter release cycles are conspiring to threaten both software reliability and security. The work described in this paper is an attempt to baseline and (internally) benchmark the state of our company's software security, and also includes some data regarding the state of software reliability across the company's products. Of particular interest in this study is learning more about the extent of software vulnerabilities emanating from the open source software that we import and use in our commercial products. Prior evidence had been building that suggested that such 'third-party software' (TPS) is inherently more vulnerable to security (and reliability) problems. We have examined the software vulnerability occurrences across all the company's software, in the aggregate, and have found that the TPS used in our products, primarily open source software, initially contains more vulnerabilities than internally-produced software. Security and reliability problems, both in terms of bug counts and percentages of total code volume, correlate quite well, and examples of this are also shown, but we cannot rely on this concurrence in our study: Software security on its own has been examined in detail, and while some findings are documented here, many questions remain.",

              "abstract": "Using university capstone courses to teach agile software development methodologies has become commonplace, as agile methods have gained support in professional software development. This usually means students are introduced to and work with the currently most popular agile methodology: Scrum. However, as the agile methods employed in the industry change and are adapted to different contexts, university courses must follow suit. A prime example of this is the Kanban method, which has recently gathered attention in the industry. In this paper, we describe a capstone course design, which adds the hands-on learning of the lean principles advocated by Kanban into a capstone project run with Scrum. This both ensures that students are aware of recent process frameworks and ideas as well as gain a more thorough overview of how agile methods can be employed in practice. We describe the details of the course and analyze the participating students' perceptions as well as our observations. We analyze the development artifacts, created by students during the course in respect to the two different development methodologies. We further present a summary of the lessons learned as well as recommendations for future similar courses. The survey conducted at the end of the course revealed an overwhelmingly positive attitude of students towards the integration of Kanban into the course.",

This usually means students are introduced to and work with the currently most popular agile methodology: Scrum. However, as the agile methods employed in the industry change and are adapted to different contexts, university courses must follow suit. A prime example of this is the Kanban method, which has recently gathered attention in the industry. In this paper, we describe a capstone course design, which adds the hands-on learning of the lean principles advocated by Kanban into a capstone project run with Scrum.

We compare the classification results of a camera-based frame-by-frame semantic segmentation model Machine with a well-established visual saliency model Human on the Cityscapes dataset. The results show that Machine classifies foreground objects better if they are more salient, indicating a similarity with the human visual system. For background objects, the accuracy drops when the saliency increases, giving evidence for the assumption that Machine has an implicit concept of saliency.",

This paper focuses on support for teams of performers, working independently as well as in close collaboration, in stressful situations that are life critical. Our recent work has three main thrusts: provide effective real-time guidance for closely collaborating teams; develop and evaluate techniques for measuring cognitive load based on biometric observations and human surveys; and, using these measurements plus analysis and discrete event process simulation, predict cognitive load throughout the process model and propose process modifications to help performers better manage high cognitive load situations. This project is a collaboration among software engineers, surgical team members, human factors researchers, and medical equipment instrumentation experts. Experimental prototype capabilities are being built and evaluated based upon process models of two cardiovascular surgery processes, Aortic Valve Replacement (AVR) and Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG). In this paper we describe our approach for each of the three research thrusts by illustrating our work for heparinization, a common subprocess of both AVR and CABG.

Buffered workspace awareness keeps a segment of the developer’s actions around an inferred difficulty as context, and allows the recording to be played a single or multiple times. Semi-structured interviews with mentor-intern pairs in a large company showed that they liked the general idea of buffered workspace awareness. We performed a two-phase user study where observers used both single- and multi-pass awareness to determine the problems developers’ had and the solution to those problems. Almost all solutions required a one-line fix. We could find no statistical difference in the correctness of their solutions in the two conditions, though the observers overwhelmingly preferred and were more confident using the multi-pass mechanism, and made use of its rewind and pause commands. Both kinds of mechanisms allowed the observers to solve the majority of problems by looking only at 5 minutes of the workers’ interaction before the difficulty. The time spent by them processing the context was a small fraction of the time spent by the developers on the difficulties. The time wasted on abandoned difficulties was a small fraction of the time spent on difficulties.",

Our questionnaire includes elements from job satisfaction surveys and one software development specific element.

Competency evaluation is an integral part of the daily routine at Sigma IT Consulting. Therefore, negative effects of competency sheets on developers and managers cannot be tolerated.

We base our discussion mainly on our personal experiences with industry-academia collaborations. To determine whether these experiences also apply to other developers, we additionally conducted a survey with 89 participants from academia and industry.

Objectives: This study investigated attitudes of the empirical software engineering community, as exemplified by attendees at an research focused conference, to the hypothesis that an analogue of the Cochrane Collaboration would be beneficial. Method: An online survey was employed to capture opinions of participants in the EASE’16 conference on the hypothesis.

These features demand sound and scalable approaches to deal with the increasing design space. Consequently, standards (e.g. like ISO26262) propose methods and techniques for the systematic development of (in this case: automotive) systems. The growing amount of functionality correspondingly require more powerful electronic platforms and thus methods to deal with the integration.

These features demand sound and scalable approaches to deal with the increasing design space. Consequently, standards (e.g. like ISO26262) propose methods and techniques for the systematic development of (in this case: automotive) systems. The growing amount of functionality correspondingly require more powerful electronic platforms and thus methods to deal with the integration.

The SPS Reconfiguration is the ability to react to electrical failure and to restore critical operations for granting vessel survivability. This work illustrate why SPS Reconfiguration software system may be implemented as a self-adaptive system. To illustrate this relation we exploit a systematic classification of SPS reconfiguration methods, by highlighting terms and attributes related to self-adaptive systems. In particular, the research method considers four types of self-adaptation systems with different degrees of autonomy and proactivity.

The SPS Reconfiguration is the ability to react to electrical failure and to restore critical operations for granting vessel survivability. This work illustrate why SPS Reconfiguration software system may be implemented as a self-adaptive system. To illustrate this relation we exploit a systematic classification of SPS reconfiguration methods, by highlighting terms and attributes related to self-adaptive systems. In particular, the research method considers four types of self-adaptation systems with different degrees of autonomy and proactivity. The corresponding data analysis highlights a strong correlation between SPS Reconfiguration and Self-Adaptive systems, revealing most of the SPS reconfiguration techniques found in literature often belong to three of the four types of adaptation. The outcome of the paper is proposing SPS as an interesting benchmark for comparing self-adaptive approaches, also highlighting scenarios, tasks, norms goals and quality aspects with the support of the IEEE specifications.",

A case study on two open source companies, Cloudera and Hortonworks, is performed. The software ecosystem health and financial performance of both companies are assessed. Results. Cloudera is healthier in terms of robustness and niche creation, while Hortonworks is healthier in terms of productivity. Financially, Cloudera performs better than Hortonworks. Conclusion. The following hypotheses are formulated. Software ecosystem health has an expected positive relation with financial performance. Niche creation health is the main contributor to this relation, robustness health is a minor reason for this relation, and software ecosystem productivity health has little to no influence.",

We believe that analyzing end-user reviews and utilizing analysis tools are a crucial step towards understanding the complete picture of the quality of a software product, as well as towards reasoning about the evolution history of it. In this paper, we investigate whether both methods correlate with one another. In other words, we explore if there exists a relationship between user satisfaction and the application's internal quality characteristics. To conduct our research, we analyze a total of 46 actual releases of three Android open source software (OSS) applications on the Google Play Store. For each release, we employ multiple static analysis tools to assess several aspects of the application's software quality. We retrieve and manually analyze the complete reviews after each release of each application from its store page, totaling 1004 reviews. Our initial results suggest that having high or low code quality does not necessary ensure user overall satisfaction.",

On the non-technical side, I argue for a clear separation of responsibilities (providers need to do the bulk of the work for the update), as well as a growing need to document acceptable usage of an API, be it a library or programming language. In many languages, there are very few changes to an API that are provably safe without this idea: just because a user’s code currently works does not mean that it is supported and can be expected to continue to work indefinitely under maintenance. Taken together, these two approaches form what I believe to be a minimum set of requirements when approaching software sustainability.",

The main challenges include vote privacy and anonymity, ballot irrevocability and transparency throughout the vote counting process. The introduction of the blockchain as a basis for cryptocurrency protocols, provides for the exploitation of the immutability and transparency properties of these distributed ledgers. In this paper, we discuss possible uses of the blockchain technology to implement a secure and fair voting system. In particular, we introduce a secret share-based voting system on the blockchain, the so-called SHARVOT protocol. Our solution uses Shamir's Secret Sharing to enable on-chain, i.e. within the transactions script, votes submission and winning candidate determination.

The main challenges include vote privacy and anonymity, ballot irrevocability and transparency throughout the vote counting process. The introduction of the blockchain as a basis for cryptocurrency protocols, provides for the exploitation of the immutability and transparency properties of these distributed ledgers. In this paper, we discuss possible uses of the blockchain technology to implement a secure and fair voting system. In particular, we introduce a secret share-based voting system on the blockchain, the so-called SHARVOT protocol. Our solution uses Shamir's Secret Sharing to enable on-chain, i.e. within the transactions script, votes submission and winning candidate determination. The protocol is also using a shuffling technique, Circle Shuffle, to de-link voters from their submissions.",

One of the most popular blockchain platforms that supports smart contracts are Ethereum. As smart contracts typically handle money, ensuring their low number of faults and vulnerabilities are essential. To aid smart contract developers and help maturing the technology, we need analysis tools and studies for smart contracts. As an initiative for this, we propose the adoption of some well-known OO metrics for Solidity smart contracts. Furthermore, we analyze more than 10,000 smart contracts with our prototype tool. The results suggest that smart contract programs are short, not overly complex and either quite well-commented or not commented at all. Moreover, smart contracts could benefit from an external library and dependency management mechanism, as more than 80% of the defined libraries in Solidity files code the same functionalities.",
