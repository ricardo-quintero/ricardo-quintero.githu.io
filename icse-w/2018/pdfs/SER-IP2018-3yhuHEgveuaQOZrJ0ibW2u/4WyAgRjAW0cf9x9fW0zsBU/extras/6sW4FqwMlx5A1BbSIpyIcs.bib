  abstract={"Five years ago Marc Andreessen, the Web pioneer and celebrated tech investor, predicted software would eat the world. He turned out to be right. Too right. Software is eating the world, and also eating itself. The cannibalization of software defies easy explanation. Software is the motor of the world's digital economy. Code is the ground of our computationally rich existence. Software applications and platforms are the source of vast wealth for Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon, and many other tech titans. Yet even as software grows in importance, code becomes less visible, less tangible, less understood, and perhaps most paradoxically–less valuable in monetary terms.},

  abstract = "Abstract The International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering (EASE) had its twentieth anniversary in 2016, with that year’s edition hosted in Limerick, Ireland. Founded in 1997, the \{EASE\} conference was the first event solely dedicated to encouraging empirical research in software engineering, and its founders have been longtime advocates of evidence-based software engineering (EBSE). In this editorial, we briefly look back at the history of \{EBSE\} and the \{EASE\} conference. We then introduce the four articles which are revised and extended versions of papers presented at \{EASE\} 2016. We conclude by looking at the future of EBSE, and provide some suggestions for conducting and reporting empirical research. "

  abstract = "Abstract Context: The global software industry and the software engineering (SE) academia are two large communities. However, unfortunately, the level of joint industry-academia collaborations in \{SE\} is still relatively very low, compared to the amount of activity in each of the two communities. It seems that the two ’camps’ show only limited interest/motivation to collaborate with one other. Many researchers and practitioners have written about the challenges, success patterns (what to do, i.e., how to collaborate) and anti-patterns (what not do do) for industry-academia collaborations. Objective: To identify (a) the challenges to avoid risks to the collaboration by being aware of the challenges, (b) the best practices to provide an inventory of practices (patterns) allowing for an informed choice of practices to use when planning and conducting collaborative projects. Method: A systematic review has been conducted. Synthesis has been done using grounded-theory based coding procedures. Results: Through thematic analysis we identified 10 challenge themes and 17 best practice themes. A key outcome was the inventory of best practices, the most common ones recommended in different contexts were to hold regular workshops and seminars with industry, assure continuous learning from industry and academic sides, ensure management engagement, the need for a champion, basing research on real-world problems, showing explicit benefits to the industry partner, be agile during the collaboration, and the co-location of the researcher on the industry side. Conclusion: Given the importance of industry-academia collaboration to conduct research of high practical relevance we provide a synthesis of challenges and best practices, which can be used by researchers and practitioners to make informed decisions on how to structure their collaborations.
